5. Once you have reserved an environment, you will receive an email with a link to access the management console for the environment including a password (**Desktop Access Information**). It also contains a **URL to access the IBM RPA Rest Service remotely (Application Service Information)**, please copy the Application Service Information URL and change **HTTP** to **HTTPS**. This will be used in the Workflow solution.
