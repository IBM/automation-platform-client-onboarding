# Client Onboarding Scenario

The following instructions assume that you have created a ROKS cluster with IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation using the instructions [here](https://github.com/IBM/cp4ba-rapid-deployment). 

The solution contains various components of the CP4BA platform. The following instructions will go over the steps to import the solution for each component:

1. Import the ADS ML Model
2. Import the ADS Project
3. Import the Workflow Solution
4. Import objects into FileNetContent Manager
