# Client Onboarding Scenario

## Introduction

The client onboarding scenario is an end-to-end solution that showcases the art of the possible with IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation (CP4BA). You can see the end-to-end in action with this [pre-recorded video](http://ibm.biz/cp4ba-overview-video).

## Prerequisistes

1. A CP4BA cluster:
   - You can create a new cluster on IBM Cloud using ROKS using the SWAT team's [rapid deployment scripts](https://github.com/IBM/cp4ba-rapid-deployment).
   - You can use your existing cluster with the following patterns: foundation, decisions_ads, application, document_processing, workflow and content. You also need to install [Open Prediction Service](https://github.com/IBM/open-prediction-service-hub/tree/main/ops-implementations/ads-ml-service) to execute some of the AI capabilities of the scenario.
   - You can request a new cluster to be created for you using the [technical sales activation kit](https://techzone.ibm.com/collection/cloud-pak-for-automation-activation-kit). You also need to install [Open Prediction Service](https://github.com/IBM/open-prediction-service-hub/tree/main/ops-implementations/ads-ml-service) to execute some of the AI capabilities of the scenario.
