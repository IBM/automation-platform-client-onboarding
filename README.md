# Client Onboarding Scenario

The client onboarding scenario is an end-to-end solution that showcases the art of the possible with IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation (CP4BA). A pre-recorded video of the scenario is available [here](http://ibm.biz/cp4ba-overview-video). 

The instructions below show you how to import the solution into an existing CP4BA v21.0.1 installation. The instructions also assume that you have Open Prediction Service installed to execute the AI models required by the Decisions capability of the platform.

**Note:** If you don't have an existing CP4BA install, you can request a pre-installed cluster using the links [here](https://techzone.ibm.com/collection/reserve-here-cloud-pak-for-business-automation-open-shift-demo-environments#tab-1). 
The pre-installed cluster is a demo deployment and does not contain Open Prediction Service. You can follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/IBM/open-prediction-service-hub/tree/main/ops-implementations/ads-ml-service) to set it up if you want to show the client onboarding scenario backed by AI. Alternatively, you can setup your own enterprise deployment with Open Prediction Service using the instructions [here](https://github.ibm.com/Automation-Elite/cp4ba-rapid-deployment-scripts) (currently available to IBMers only).

1. [Import the ADS ML Model](/Step%201%20-%20ADS%20ML%20Model.md)
2. [Import the ADS Project](/Step%202%20-%20ADS%20Project.md)
3. [Setup the RPA Server (optional)](/Step%203%20-%20RPA%20Server.md)
4. [Import the Workflow Solution](/Step%204%20-%20Workflow%20Solution.md)
5. [Import objects into FileNetContent Manager](/Step%205%20-%20Content%20Manager.md)
6. [Import the Business Automation Application app](/Step%206%20-%20Business%20Automation%20Application.md)
7. [Import the Business Automation Insights data](/Step%207%20-%20Business%20Automation%20Insights.md)

Once you have imported the Client Onboarding scenario successfully, you can perform the [IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation labs](https://github.com/IBM/cp4ba-labs).
